# Project Initialization Mantra

## Quick Setup Command

**When entering any new repository for the first time, use this instruction:**

---

**"Initialize project context for this repository. First understand the complete project structure, technology stack, and existing patterns. Then establish clean project context that integrates with my global CLAUDE.md behavioral principles without conflicts or overlaps."**

---

## What This Accomplishes

### Discovery Phase
- Maps complete directory structure and key files
- Identifies technology stack, frameworks, and dependencies  
- Understands existing code patterns and conventions
- Reviews any existing project documentation or README files

### Context Integration
- Creates project-specific context that **enhances** rather than conflicts with global behavioral principles
- Avoids duplicating global rules (Simplest Solution Principle, One Question at a Time, etc.)
- Focuses on project-specific technical requirements, workflows, and constraints
- Establishes clear boundaries between global behavior and project-specific needs

### Result
- Clean, non-conflicting project context
- Immediate understanding of development workflow
- Ready to engage at appropriate level (consultant/planner/coder)
- No procedural overhead or competing behavioral requirements

## Usage Pattern

1. **Enter new repository**
2. **Paste the setup command above**
3. **Begin working immediately with optimized context**

This eliminates the need to:
- Manually explain project structure
- Resolve behavioral conflicts between global and project context  
- Repeat global behavioral principles in project files
- Navigate competing or overlapping requirements

The result is **clean, effective project engagement from the first interaction.**
