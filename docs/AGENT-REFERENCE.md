## Integration with Challenge Mode

All agents operate within the **Challenge Mode framework**:

- **Default behavior**: Question assumptions and probe for edge cases
- **Certainty threshold**: 85-90% confidence required before agent selection  
- **Multi-agent consensus**: Complex decisions require multiple agent review
- **Procedural override**: "execute as planned" disables challenges for approved tasks

## Agent Selection Protocol

### Automatic Routing
The system analyzes task requirements and automatically routes to appropriate agents based on:
- **Domain keywords** (e.g., "Python optimization" â†’ `python-pro`)
- **Task complexity** (complex tasks may involve multiple agents)
- **Business context** (CME-related tasks integrate business intelligence)

### Manual Selection
Explicitly specify agents for precise control:
```bash
Task("Optimize database queries", "PostgreSQL performance issues", "database-optimizer")
Task("Review security implications", "Authentication system design", "security-auditor")  
Task("Plan deployment strategy", "Multi-region rollout", "deployment-engineer")
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
High-impact decisions automatically involve multiple agents:
```bash
# System automatically engages multiple specialists
Task("Design payment system", "High-volume transaction processing", "payment-integration")
# May also engage: security-auditor, database-optimizer, performance-engineer
```

## Adding New Agents

See [INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md](./INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on adding domain-specific agents for new knowledge areas beyond CME business intelligence.
